    "My research interests and future plans focus primarily on the intersection of quantum computing and quantum machine learning, specifically on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) and Quantum Walks. Previously, my work has emphasized using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for simulating large chemical molecules by employing a divide-and-conquer approach via Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET). However, this approach remains computationally slow and highly reliant on specialized knowledge in quantum chemistry.\n",

    "#### Divide-and-Conquer VQE (RSNN-VQE)\n",
    "To address these challenges, I recently proposed a novel algorithmic framework combining the divide-and-conquer VQE approach with machine learning techniques. Specifically, I partition large-scale problems, such as extensive molecular systems or large matrices, into smaller fragments, each independently solved using VQE. Subsequently, a machine learning model, such as a Random Sampling Neural Network, is trained to model interactions between these fragments. By summing the energies of individual fragments and adding interaction energies predicted by the machine learning model, we can approximate the total energy of large systems efficiently. The general applicability of this approach allows its extension beyond molecular systems to a wide array of large matrix problems.\n",

    "#### LSTM-VQE\n",
    "Furthermore, I have unique insights regarding improving the initialization efficiency of VQE. Traditionally, the initial wavefunction in VQE is randomly guessed, which is extremely time-consuming for large-scale systems. Hence, I have developed the LSTM-VQE method, utilizing an LSTM neural network to learn better initial wavefunctions from past VQE computations, significantly accelerating convergence. Currently, I am also applying LSTM-VQE to predict wavefunctions for large molecular systems, demonstrating promising results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding further, I aim to introduce a transfer learning (TL) strategy, resulting in the LSTM-VQE-TL framework. In this architecture, an additional neural network layer is integrated after the LSTM, enabling the model to adapt efficiently to quantum systems of varying scales and structures without requiring complete retraining each time. Through this transfer learning mechanism, we can effectively transfer experience and knowledge across various related yet differently scaled quantum problems, substantially reducing computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, these methodologies not only enhance the efficiency of quantum computations but also foster the integration of quantum computing with machine learning. They hold great promise as a key technological pathway for solving large-scale quantum problems in the future."
